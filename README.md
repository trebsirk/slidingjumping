# slidingjumping

1-d puzzle

Start with 1-d grid of heads (h) and tails (t) on opposite sides, e.g., hhh_ttt. 

## Goal

reverse from hhh_ttt to ttt_hhh using only slides and jumps. 

## Rules

Slides and jumps can only move "forward" toward the goal state--there are no backward slides or jumps. A coin can only slide into an empty slot and a coin can only jump over a coin of the opposite quality, i.e., heads can only jump tails, and tails can only jump heads.
